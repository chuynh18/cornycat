# Corny cat page!

## About

This is just a bunch of files (that happen to constitute a silly little page).  I made this so that I can walk my students through using git to push files to GitHub, then enabling GitHub Pages so they can have the experience of deploying a website live for the first time.

## To my students

Congratulations!  If you're reading this on GitHub (by browsing to the repo you just created and pushed files to), you've successfully pushed the files that make up a website to GitHub.  Now, you just need to enable GitHub Pages, and you'll have successfully deployed a website live for the entire world to see.
